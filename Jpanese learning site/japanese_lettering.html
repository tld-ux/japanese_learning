    <h2>Hiragana script</h2>
    <p.block> 
        Hiragana (ひらがな) is a phonetic syllabary, 
        or script, used in the Japanese writing system. 
        It is one of three scripts used in Japanese, 
        along with katakana and kanji.

    <h2>Katakana script</h2>
    <p.block>
        Katakana (カタカナ) is a Japanese syllabary script 
        used for foreign loanwords, onomatopoeia, scientific 
        terms, and emphasis, distinct from hiragana which 
        is used for native Japanese words. It consists of 
        angular, straight-lined characters that represent 
        the same sounds as hiragana but have a different 
        visual style. Katakana is one of the three main 
        writing systems in Japanese, along with hiragana 
        and kanji.

    <h2>Kanji script</h2>
    <p.block>
        Kanji are logographic characters, or Chinese characters, 
        that were adapted from China and are used in the Japanese 
        writing system along with the phonetic scripts hiragana 
        and katakana. Each character represents a meaning and a 
        word, and they are used primarily for nouns, verb stems, 
        and adjectives, while kana are used for native words, 
        grammatical particles, and endings. 
        Learning kanji is essential for reading and writing 
        Japanese, and while there are tens of thousands of 
        characters, an official list of 2,136 general-use kanji 
        is taught in schools.
